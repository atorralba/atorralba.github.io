In this blog, I will post write-ups of challenges I solve, research on topics of my interest, and really *anything* that seems interesting enough to me and to whoever can be reading this, always IT-security related. The main goal of writing this is learning and leaving some kind of log of what I achieve, maybe portraying some progress (or at least I hope so). My English isn't wonderful, so please have that in mind. You can contact me via social media (below) if you want to discuss any of the posts, correct any mistake you find, or simply say hi.
